        "Modification": "Install multiple grab bars in the tub/shower area: one vertical bar near the entry on the side wall, and one horizontal bar along the back wall. Consider an additional angled bar on the control wall if space allows.",
        "Rationale": "The high tub wall presents a significant fall risk during entry and exit for someone with mobility and balance issues. Grab bars provide crucial support points for stabilization, reducing the likelihood of slips and falls, aligning with fall prevention best practices.",
        "Cost": "$$",
        "Installation": "Requires locating wall studs or using appropriate heavy-duty wall anchors. Bars are securely screwed into the wall structure. Professional installation recommended to ensure proper weight-bearing capacity."

        "Modification": "Replace the standard height toilet with an ADA-compliant 'comfort height' toilet (typically 17-19 inches high from floor to seat) OR add a raised toilet seat with integrated armrests to the existing toilet.",
        "Rationale": "A standard height toilet can be difficult to sit down on and stand up from for individuals with reduced leg strength, mobility limitations, or balance problems. A taller toilet reduces the distance and effort required, making transfers safer and easier, conserving energy, and decreasing fall risk during toileting.",
        "Cost": "$$-$$$",
        "Installation": "Replacing the toilet involves shutting off water, draining, removing the old toilet, setting a new wax ring, installing the new toilet, and reconnecting the water supply. A raised seat simply clamps onto the existing bowl. Adding grab bars (separate suggestion, but often done concurrently) involves locating studs/using anchors."

        "Modification": "Replace the fixed shower head with a handheld shower head mounted on an adjustable vertical slide bar. Ensure the controls incorporate an anti-scald valve.",
        "Rationale": "A handheld shower head allows the user to direct water flow while seated or standing, accommodating varying mobility levels and improving bathing independence and thoroughness. The adjustable bar allows positioning for different heights. An anti-scald valve prevents burns, crucial for those who may have slower reaction times or difficulty adjusting controls quickly.",
        "Cost": "$$",
        "Installation": "Typically involves unscrewing the old shower head/arm and screwing in the new slide bar and handheld unit components. May require minor plumbing adjustments depending on existing connections. Anti-scald valve installation is more involved, often requiring plumber access behind the wall."
